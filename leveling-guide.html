Leveling your Warlock as Affliction is all about your damage over time abilites.  is the most powerful DoT in the game and, thanks to , you heal for 40% for all of the damage dealt by , making this the most important spell in your spellbook. The sooner you get this on your target, the sooner you start to heal. The best part of this spell is that the more  you apply, the more healing you will recieve. For this reason, you want to put  on as many targets as you can to benefit from the massive amount of healing you get. Depending on your gear level, often times  will be enough to finish off the enemies. However, that's not the same for boosted Warlocks.
 is the perfect pairing DoT to go with  if you don't have gear or if you have been boosted. The long DoT duration, mixed with the power and self healing of , makes these two DoTs a deadly combination.  is a ramping DoT, meaning it does very little damage at first, but ends up hitting harder than most other DoT's in the game towards the end. Place  followed by  on every target for maximum damage. If you find yourself pulling 6+ targets at once, apply  on all enemies followed by . This will give you all the self heals ticking before you start spreading your Agonies. If you're fighting anything under 5 targets, you should not need to worry about incoming damage. You can simply  into  on one mob, repeated for all mobs in the pack.

It may be used to open with it on some targets if you feel like standing still and casting it.  is rarely used when leveling, however this spell can be very helpful if you find yourself either pulling too much, fighting high HP mobs, elite mobs or if you want the healing from it. If you find yourself not using  often, feel free to remove the points from  and  and put them into the Demonology tree.
3.1. 
AoE Leveling Rotation as Affliction
Warlocks have a very powerul AoE in , however the best way to AoE while leveling out in the open world is simply to  and  everything around you. When the mobs get close to you, a few ticks or  tend to finish them off all while barely hurting you at all due to the insane self heals coming from  and .
3.2. 
Pets for Leveling as Affliction
Your Demon choice depends largely on your personal preference. Each Demon has its own strengths and utility, all viable in their own way.
The rework on , which takes a portion of your Voidwalkers Health and gives you absorb for a ton of damage, is extrememly useful. You can pop this while you have  ticking and you'll see your Health shoot right back up to full. Voidwalker also has the ability to AoE taunt, reducing the chance all enemies hit by 10%, further improved by the talent, . All of this combined makes this the go-to pet for Affliction leveling.
The Felhunter deals above average damage thanks to their new spell, , while bringing you the most utility out of the demons with its ability to interrupt Spells with  and purge any nasty debuffs off you or your target with .
The Succubus, or Incubus, are great pets that remain an integral part of a Warlock's aresenal, as they do excellent damage while not needing to use their Mana to do so. Thanks to , this allows you to use the Succubus as a permanent source of Mana.
The Imp is a stong pet, however is usually used only for Destruction.

Some spells that you can skip training until level 80 are listed below in order of which they become available on your trainer.
